This demonstration website of the proof of concept based on a flask-web application is made by Dries de Roover, Michael Osuntuyi and Marya Dukmak.
This is a short explanation on how the proof of concept works. Make sure you have python 3 succesfully installed.
1. Firstly, install the requirements.text via pip/python3 to install all the dependencies;
2. Then run app.py and click on the link provided in the console;
3. You're all set. The system is now running locally on your PC.
When you want to have it running on a server, follow the same steps but add the following:
- Use a Screen like library on your linux system before running app.py;
- The application should then be still running on the server after you closed the command line window.
